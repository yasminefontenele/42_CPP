# 42_CPP
This repository summarizes my experience learning C++ at 42 School.
Through these projects, I am solidifying my understanding of C++ fundamentals and also diving into object-oriented programming.
After my C programming experience, I have come to appreciate the power and flexibility of C++ in creating efficient and sophisticated software solutions.

### learning from each module:

**CPP00** - Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static, consts and some other basic stufs;<br>
**CPP01** - Memory allocation, pointers to members, references and switch statement;<br>
**CPP02** - Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading and Orthodox Canonical class form;<br>
**CPP03** - Inheritance;<br>
**CPP04** - Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces;<br>
**CPP05** - Repetition and exceptions;<br>
**CPP06** - Casts;<br>
**CPP07** - Templates;<br>
**CPP08** - Templated containers, iterators, algorithms;<br>
**CPP09** - STL;<br>
