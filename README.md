# 42_CPP
This repository summarizes my experience learning C++ at 42 School.
Through these projects, I am solidifying my understanding of C++ fundamentals and also diving into object-oriented programming.
After my C programming experience, I have come to appreciate the power and flexibility of C++ in creating efficient and sophisticated software solutions.
